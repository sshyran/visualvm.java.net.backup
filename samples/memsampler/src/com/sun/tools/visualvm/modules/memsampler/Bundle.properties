OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Profiling
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin provides an experimental sampling memory profiler. \
    It uses the same technology as 'jmap -histo' to obtain the data and thus works only for local Java applications running Sun JDK 6 & 7. \
    An extra feature over the 'jmap' tool is a possibility to display delta results between the samples.
