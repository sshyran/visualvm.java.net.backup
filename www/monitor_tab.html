        <h1>Monitoring an Application</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM presents data for local and remote applications in a tab specific for that application.
        When you open an application in VisualVM, each application opens in a new tab in the main window.
        You can have multiple application tabs open.</p>
        
        <h3>Monitoring an Application</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to monitor a local application and view high-level data on thread activity and 
        memory heap, and garbage collection in the VM.</p>
        <p>The Monitor tab is a sub-tab of the application tab and displays real-time, high-level data about the memory heap
        thread activity and classes loaded in the VM.
        Monitoring an application imposes low overhead and can be used for extended periods.</p>

        <p>The Monitor tab has the following graphs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Heap.</b> The Heap graphs displays the total heap size and how much of the heap is currently used. 
            These are the figures that a Java application can obtain using the <tt>java.lang.Runtime.totalMemory()</tt>
            and java.lang.Runtime.freeMemory() calls.</li>
            <li><b>PermGen.</b> The PermGen graph displays changes in the permanent generation area over time.
            The permanent generation is the area of the heap where class and method objects are stored. 
            If an application loads a very large number of classes, then the size of the permanent generation might need to be increased using the -XX:MaxPermSize option.
            The PermGen statistics are retrieved using the <tt>jmap</tt> utility and
            display the relationship between the used permgen space and the total size of the permgen space.</li>
            <li><b>Classes</b> The Classes graph displays an overview of the total number of loaded classes and shared classes.</li>
            <li><b>Threads.</b> The Threads graphs displays an overview of the number of live and daemon threads in the application's JVM.
            You can use VisualVM to take a thread dump if you want to capture and view exact data on application threads at 
            a specific point in time. 
            For more, see <a href="threads.html">Monitoring Application Threads</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Monitoring tab contains buttons that enable you to perform the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Perform GC</b> Click Perform GC to perform garbage collection immediately.</li>
            <li><b>Heap Dump.</b> Click Heap Dump to take a <a href="heapdump.html">heap dump</a>. 
            When you take a heap dump, a tab displaying the heap dump opens in the application tab. 
            A node for the heap dump appears under the node for the application in the Applications window.
            For more, see <a href="heapdump.html">Browsing a Heap Dump</a>.</li>
        </ul>
