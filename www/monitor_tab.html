        <h1>Monitoring an Application</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM presents data for local and remote applications in a tab specific for that application.
        When you open an application in VisualVM, each application opens in a new tab in the main window.
        You can have multiple application tabs open.</p>
        

        <p>The Monitor tab is a sub-tab of the application tab that displays real-time, high-level data about the memory heap
        thread activity and classes loaded in the VM.
        Monitoring an application imposes low overhead and can be used for extended periods.</p>
        <p>The Monitor tab has graphs that display the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Heap.</b> Displays the total heap size and how much of the heap is currently used. 
            These are the figures that a Java application can obtain using the <tt>java.lang.Runtime.totalMemory()</tt>
            and java.lang.Runtime.freeMemory() calls.</li>
            <li><b>PermGen.</b>
            The permanent generation is the area of the heap where class and method objects are stored. 
            If an application loads a very large number of classes, then the size of the permanent generation might need to be increased using the -XX:MaxPermSize option.
            The PermGen graph displays information retrieved using the <tt>jmap</tt> utility.
            The PermGen graph displays the relationship between the used permgen space and the total size of the permgen space.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Classes</b> The Classes graph displays information about the total number of loaded classes and shared classes.</li>
            <li><b>Threads.</b> Displays the current number of live and daemon threads in the application's JVM.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you are monitoring a local application, you can perform the following actions from within VisualVM.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Perform GC</b> Click this to perform garbage collection immediately.</li>
            <li><b>Heap Dump.</b> Click this to take a <a href="heapdump.html">heap dump</a>. When you take a heap dump,
            a tab displaying the heap dump opens in the application tab. 
            A node for the heap dump appears under the node for the application in the Applications window.

        </ul>
