        <h1>Getting Started with VisualVM</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>VisualVM provides detailed information about Java applications while they are running on the Java Virutal Machine (JVM). 
        VisualVM's graphical user interface enables you to quickly and easily see information about multiple Java applications.</p>
        
        <p>This getting started guide should help you quickly get up and running with the VisualVM.
        This guide will demonstrate how to install VisualVM and add functionality to the tool by installing a plugin from the VisualVM update center.
        This guide will show you how to launch VisualVM and view some of the information you can get about an application running on the local JVM and a remote JVM.</p>
        
        <h3>Installing VisualVM</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Download and unzip the VisualVM installer.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the VisualVM installation directory and launch the application.</li>
        </ol>    

        <h3>Using the Applications Window</h3>
        <p>The main window of VisualVM opens when you launch the application.
        By default, the Applications window is displayed in the left pane of the main window.
        The Applications window enables you to quickly see the Java applications running on the local and remote JVMs.</p>
        <img src="images/getstarted/vvm-anagram-applications.png" style="border:1px solid;" alt="screenshot of Applications window" 
        title="screenshot of Applications window">
        <p>The Applications window is the primary entry point for viewing further details about a particular application.
        Right-clicking an application node opens the popup menu where you can choose to open the main application tab or take thread or heap dumps.</p>

        <h3>Browsing a Heap Dump</h3>
        <p>VisualVM has a visualizer that enables you to easily browse heap dumps.
        You can load an existing heap dump or take a snapshot of the heap for local running applications.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; Load to open a saved heap dump. The heap dump opens in a tab in the main window.</li>
            <li>Click Classes in the Heap Dump toolbar to view a list of the live classes and corresponding instances.</li>
            <li>Double-click a class name to open the Instances view to view a list of the instances.</li>
            <li>Select an instance from the list to view the references that instance.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/getstarted/vvm-anagram-heapdump.png" style="border:1px solid;" alt="screenshot of Instances tab of heap dump" 
        title="screenshot of Instances tab of heap dump">
        
        <p>To take a heap dump of a local application, right-click an application's node in the Applications window and choose Heap Dump.
        When you click Heap Dump, VisualVM opens the heap dump in a new tab and creates a node for the heap dump under the application node
        in the Applications window.
        To save the generated heap dump, right-click the heap dump node and choose Save As.
        If you do not explicitly save the generated heap dump, the dump will be deleted when the application closes.</p>

        <h3>Profiling an Application</h3>
        <p>VisualVM includes a profiler that enables you to profile applications running on your local JVM.
        You access the profiling controls in the Profiler tab of the application tab.
        The profiler enables you to analyze memory usage and CPU performance of local applications.<br/>
        <b>Note.</b> To profile an application running on JDK 6, you need to turn off class sharing for the application otherwise the application may crash.
        To turn off class sharing, start the application with <tt>-Xshare:off</tt> argument.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Launch a local Java application. (Start the application with the <tt>-Xshare:off</tt> argument.)</li>
            <li>Under the Locals node in the Applications window, right-click the application node and choose Open to open the application tab.</li>
            <li>Click the Profiler tab in the application tab.</li>
            <li>Click Memory or CPU in the the Profiler tab.
            <p>When you click Memory, VisualVM instruments the application and displays the profiling data in the Profiler tab.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        title="Screenshot showing the profiling results when analyzing memory allocation">

      
        <h3>Connecting to a Remote Host</h3>
        <p>VisualVM enables you to easily monitor applications running on remote hosts and view general data about the remote system. 
        To view information about applications on remote hosts, you must first connect to the remote host.
        Connected remote hosts are listed below the Remote node in the Applications window.
        Expand the remote host node to view the applications running on the remote host.</p>
        <p>To retrieve data from a remote application, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility needs to be running on the remote JVM.
        For more information on how to start <tt>jstatd</tt>, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html">jstatd - Virtual Machine jstat Daemon</a>.
        You cannot profile applications running on a remote host.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click Remote in the Applications window and choose Add Remote Host.</li>
            <li>In the Add Remote Host dialog box, type the host name or IP address of the remote machine.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Type a display name for the remote host. This name is displayed in the Applications window.
            If no display name is entered, the host name is used to identify the remote host in the Applications window.</li>
            <li>Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you click OK, a node for the remote host appears under the Remote node. 
        Expand the remote host node to see the Java applications that are running on the remote host.</p>
        <p>You can double-click on the name of the remote applications to open the application tab in VisualVM.</p>

        <h3>Installing VisualVM Plugins</h3>
        <p>You can add functionality to VisualVM by installing plugins available from the VisualVM update center.
        For example, installing the VisualVM-MBeans plugin adds an MBeans tab to the application tab 
        that enables you to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html#gdeap">monitor and manage MBeans</a> 
        from within VisualVM.</p>
        <p><b>To install a VisualVM plugin:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Plugins from the main menu.</li>
            <li>In the Available Plugins tab, select the Install checkbox for the plugin. Click Install.</li>
            <li>Step through and complete the plugin installer.<br/>
        </ol>
