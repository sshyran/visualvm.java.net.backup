        <h1>Working with Snapshots</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM enables you to take snapshots of application data and save the snapshots to your local system.
        Snapshots are a convenient way to capture data about an application because
        after a snapshot is saved it can be opened and viewed at any time.
        The target application does not need to be running to view the snapshot. 
        Snapshots can also be sent and viewed by other people.</p>

        <h2>Snapshot Types</h2>
        <p>Snapshots are basically archives of captured data that can then be opened in VisualVM.
        You can take and save the following types of snapshots:</p>
        
        
        <h3>Profiler Snapshots</h3>
        <p>Profiler snapshots capture profiling data at the moment the snapshot is taken.
        You can take a profiler snapshot at any time during a profiling session.
        When you take a profiler snapshot, a node representing the snapshot appears below the application
        node in the Applications window and a temporary snapshot file is written to your local system.</p>
        <p>VisualVM can take the following types of profiler snapshots</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Snapshot.</b> A memory snapshot captures profiling data on allocated objects.
            You can take a memory snapshot when you are using the profiler to analyze memory usage.
            You can compare memory snapshots session on a local application.</li>
            <li><b>CPU Snapshot.</b> You can take a CPU snapshot when you are using the profiler to analyze application performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to view a profiler snapshot later, the snapshot must be explicitly saved to your local system, 
        either as a profiler snapshot or archived in an application snapshot.</p>

        <h3>Application Snapshots</h3>
            <p>An application snapshot is an archive of heap dumps, thread dumps and profiler snapshots of an application
            that is then saved as one file (<tt>.apps</tt>).
            An application also captures general JVM information about the such as the JVM version and arguments.  
            </p>
            <p>These are saved under the Snapshots node in the Applications window.
            Application snapshots contains heap and thread dumps.
            You can take an application snapshot of a local application if you have already created
            heap or thread dumps.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Taking Snapshots</h2>
        <p>When you take a memory or CPU snapshot, the snapshot opens in the application's tab in the main window.</p>
        <p>The Snapshots node lists profiling snapshots that are saved to your local system.</p>
            
            <p>To take a snapshot during a profiling session, do one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the Take Snapshot of Collected Results button in the Profiler tab</li>
                <li>Right-click the application node and choose Profiler Snapshot.</li>
            </ul>
        
        
        <p>The snapshot toolbar enables you to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save Snapshot to Custom File</li>
            <li>Save Current View to Image</li>
            <li>Find in Results</li>
            <li>Find Next Occurence - find next occurence of search term <!-- TODO --></li>
            <li>Find Previous Occurence -find previous occurence of search term <!-- TODO --></li>
        </ul>
