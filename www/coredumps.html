        <h2>Working with Core Dumps</h2>
        <p>When you start VisualVM, the Applications window is visible in the left of the VisualVM window.
        The Applications window enables you to quickly view running local and remote applications. 
        The Applications also displays core dumps and profiling snapshots saved to your local system.</p>
        
        <p>The Core Dump node is visible in the Applications window if VisualVM is running on Solaris or Linux.
        Generally, VisualVm can only open a core dump if the core dump was taken on the same machine.
        A core dump contains informaton on the JDK and kernel of the machine where the core dump was taken.
        This information must match the JDK and kernel of the local system.
        </p>
        
        <p>A core dump is a binary file capturing the entire heap contents at the moment the dump is captured.
        When you open a core dump in VisualVm, a node for the core dump appears below the Core Dump node.
        You can right-click the core dump node and choose Heap Dump or Thread Dump
        to view the heap dump and thread dump from the core dump.
        You can then save the thread dump and heap dump to your local system.
        The core dump overview tab displays information about the application and the system properties.</p>
