        <h1>Working with Remote Applications</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM is able to access and display data about applications running on remote hosts.
        After connecting to a remote host, VisualVM can display general data about the application's runtime environment
        and can monitor memory heap and thread activity.</p>
        <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot 
        profile remote applications. </p>

        <h3>Connecting to a Remote Host</h3>
        <p>Connected remote hosts are displayed as nodes under the Remote node in the Applications window.
        When you are connected to a remote host, VisualVM displays applications running on the host as sub-nodes,
        and automatically updates the status of the remote applications, removing the applications when they
        stop and adding applications when they start.</p>
        
        <p>To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.</p> 
        <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
        needs to be running on the remote host.
        To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
        The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of JDK 6.
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html">jstatd - Virtual Machine jstat Daemon</a>
        </p>
        <p>When VisualVM is connected to a remote host, the following actions are available by right-clicking the application node:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove</li>
            <li>Rename</li>
            <li>Add JMX Connection</li>
        </ul>
            
            
        <h3>Viewing Application Data</h3>
        <p>VisualVM displays data about each running remote application in a dedicated tab in the main window.
        By default, the application tab is closed.</p>
        <p>To open the application tab, right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Open.
        When you click Open, the Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
        <p>For more see the following document:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="overview_tab.html">Viewing Application Overview</a></li></ul>


        <h3>Monitoring Application Activity</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to monitor a remote application and view high-level data on thread activity 
        and memory heap and garbage collection in the VM.</p>
