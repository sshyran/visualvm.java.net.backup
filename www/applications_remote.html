        <h2>Working with Remote Applications</h2>
        <p>When you start VisualVM, the Applications window is visible in the left of the VisualVM window.
        The Applications window enables you to quickly view running local and remote applications. 
        The Applications also displays core dumps and profiling snapshots saved to your local system.</p>
        
        <p>You can perform actions on listed items by right-clicking the node in the Applications 
        window and choosing an action from the popup menu.</p>
            
 <!--           You can view additional information and perform actions on items listed in the Applications window by 
        right-clicking a node and choosing a item from the popup menu.
        
        When you right-click a node in the Applications window, a popup menu opens
        with actions you can choose from.
        When you invoke an open tabs in the main windowNodes in the displays local and remote applications that you can connect to with VisualVM.
        The Applications window displays the process id (PID) of each application is displayed next to the application name.</p>

            <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot profile remote applications. </p>
            
            <p>Each remote application has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove</li>
                <li>Rename</li>
                <li>JMX Connection</li>

            <!--<h5>Connecting to a Remote Host</h5>
            <p>To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.</p> 
            -->
                      

          
            <h4>Remote Node</h4><a name="remote"></a>
            <p>The Remote node displays the remote hosts that VisualM is connected to.
            When you are connected to a remote host, you can expand the node for the remote host to see the Java applications that are running on that host.
            When a Java application is launched on the remote host, a node for that application is displayed under the Remote node.
            Double-click an application node to open the application tab.</p>
            
            <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot profile remote applications. </p>
            
            <h5>Connecting to a Remote Host</h5>
            <p>To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.</p> 
            <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
            needs to be running on the remote host.
            To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
            The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of JDK 6.
