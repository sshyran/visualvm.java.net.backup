        <h1>Working with Remote Applications</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM is able to access and display data about applications running on remote hosts.
        After connecting to the remote host, VisualVM can display general data about the application's runtime environment
        and can monitor thread activity.</p>
        <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot profile remote applications. </p>

        <p>The Remote node displays the remote hosts that VisualM is connected to.
        When you are connected to a remote host, you can expand the node for the remote host to see the Java applications that are running on that host.
        When a Java application is launched on the remote host, a node for that application is displayed under the Remote node.
        Right-click the application node and choose Open to open the application tab in the main window.</p>
        
        <p>You can perform actions on listed items by right-clicking the node in the Applications 
        window and choosing an action from the popup menu.</p>
            
        <h3>Connecting to a Remote Host</h3>
        <p>To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.</p> 
        <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
        needs to be running on the remote host.
        To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
        The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of JDK 6.
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html">jstatd - Virtual Machine jstat Daemon</a>
        </p>
        <p>When VisualVM is connected to a remote host, the following actions are available by right-clicking the application node:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove</li>
            <li>Rename</li>
            <li>Add JMX Connection</li>
        </ul>
            
            
        <h3>Viewing Application Data</h3>
        <p>VisualVM displays data about each running local application in a dedicated tab in the main window.
        By default, the application tab is closed.</p>
        <p>To open the application tab, right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Open.
        When you click Open, the Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="overview_tab.html">Application Overview</a></p>


        <h3>Monitoring Application Activity</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to monitor a local application and view high-level data on thread activity 
        and memory heap and garbage collection in the VM.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="monitor_tab.html">Monitoring an Application</a></p>
