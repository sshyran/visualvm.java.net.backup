        <h2>Applications Window</h2>
        <p>When you start VisualVM, the Applications window is visible in the left of the VisualVM window.
        The Applications window enables you to quickly view running local and remote applications. 
        The Applications also displays core dumps and profiling snapshots saved to your local system.</p>
        
        <p>You can perform actions on listed items by right-clicking the node in the Applications 
        window and choosing an action from the popup menu.</p>
            
 <!--           You can view additional information and perform actions on items listed in the Applications window by 
        right-clicking a node and choosing a item from the popup menu.
        
        When you right-click a node in the Applications window, a popup menu opens
        with actions you can choose from.
        When you invoke an open tabs in the main windowNodes in the displays local and remote applications that you can connect to with VisualVM.
        The Applications window displays the process id (PID) of each application is displayed next to the application name.</p>
     -->  
     <h3>Applications Window Nodes</h3>
        <p>The Applications window has the following nodes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><a href="#local">Local.</a></b> Expand the Local node to view the applications running on the local JVM.</li>
            <li><b><a href="#remote">Remote.</a></b> Expand the Remote node to view the connected remote hosts.
            Expand the node of a remote host to view the Java applications running on the remote host.</li>
            <li><b><a href="#coredump">Core Dumps.</a></b></li>
            <li><b><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots.</a></b> Expand the Snapshots node to view profiling snapshots saved to the local system.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--VisualVM cannot be used to Profile itself - only the Overview and Monitor
        tabs are enabled when VisualVM is the chosen application. -->
        
        <a name="local"></a>
            <h4>Local Node</h4>
            <p>The Local node displays the Java applications that are running on the same local JVM as VisualVM.
            VisualVM is listed as one of the local applications.
            When a Java application is launched, a node for that application is displayed under the 
            Local node. 
            The Applications window also displays the process ID (PID) for the application.</p>
            
            <p>Each local application has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Open.</b> Select this to open the tab for the application</li>
                <li><b>Thread Dump.</b> Select this to capture a thread dump for the application.
                When you capture a thread dump, the thread dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the thread dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b>Heap Dump.</b> Select this to capture a heap dump for the application.
                When you capture a heap dump, the heap dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the heap dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b>Enable Heap Dump on OOME.</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you take a thread dump or heap dump or a local application, the dump appears under the application node.</p>
            
            <!--
            <ul>
            <li><b>Open.</b> Choosepens the application tab</li>
            <li>Thread Dump - Takes a thread dump</li>
            <li>Heap Dump Takes a heap dum</li>
            <li>Enable Heap Dump on OOME - When enabled, a heap dump is taken automatically on OOME</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you double-click the application name in the Applications window, a tab for that application opens in the main window.
        Each application tab contains tabs that you use to explore the application data in greater detail.<br/>
        <b>Note.</b> VisualVM is a Java application and will always be one of the applications listed under the Local node.</p>

        <a name="remote"></a>    
            <h4>Remote Node</h4>
            <p>The Remote node displays the remote hosts that VisualM is connected to.
            When you are connected to a remote host, you can expand the node for the remote host to see the Java applications that are running on that host.
            When a Java application is launched on the remote host, a node for that application is displayed under the Remote node.
            Double-click an application node to open the application tab.</p>
            
            <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot profile remote applications. </p>
            
            <h5>Connecting to a Remote Host</h5>
            To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.</p> 
            <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
            needs to be running on the remote host.
            To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
            The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of JDK 6.
