        <h1>Using the Applications Window</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>When you start VisualVM, the Applications window is visible in the left of the VisualVM window.
        The Applications window uses a tree structure to enable you to quickly view the applications that are running on the local JVM and connected remote hosts. 
        The Applications window also displays core dumps and application snapshots.</p>

            
        <h2>Applications Window Nodes</h2>
        <p>The Application window has nodes and sub-nodes that you can expand to view running applications and saved files.
        For most nodes in the Applications window, you can view additional information and perform actions by 
        right-clicking a node and choosing an item from the popup menu.
        The actions available in the popup menu vary according to the node.</p>

        title="screenshot of VisualVM window" />
        
        <p>The Applications window has the following primary nodes:</p>
        <!--<ul>
            <li><b><a href="#local">Local.</a></b> Expand the Local node to view the applications running on the local JVM.</li>
            <li><b><a href="#remote">Remote.</a></b> Expand the Remote node to view the connected remote hosts.
            Expand the node of a remote host to view the Java applications running on the remote host.</li>
            <li><b><a href="#coredump">Core Dumps.</a></b> (Unix only)</li>
            <li><b><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots.</a></b> Expand the Snapshots node to view saved application snapshots.</li>
        </ul>-->
    
    
        

        <!--VisualVM cannot be used to Profile itself - only the Overview and Monitor
        tabs are enabled when VisualVM is the chosen application. -->
        
        
            <h3>Local Node</h3><a name="local"></a>
            <p>The Local node displays the name and process IDs (PID) of Java applications that are running on the same local JVM as VisualVM.
            When you launch VisualVM and expand the local node, VisualVM automatically displays the currently running Java applications.
            VisualVM is always listed as one of the local applications.
            When a local Java application is launched, a node for that application appears under the Local node.</p>
            
            <p>If you use VisualVM to take thread dumps, heap dumps or profiling snapshots of an application, 
            they are displayed as sub-nodes below the application node.
            The application nodes under the Local node are updated dynamically.
            When an application starts, a node for the application is automatically added.
            When an application is terminated, the node and sub-nodes for the application are removed.</p>
            <p>You can right-click a dump or snapshot sub-node to save it to your local system.
            You can create an application snapshot to collect and archive all the information collected about an application. 
            
            To create an application snapshot, right-click the application node and choose Application Snapshot.
            Saved application snapshots are visible below the <a href="#snapshots">Snapshots node</a> in the Applications window.</p>

<!--            <p>Each local application has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="overview_tab.html">Open.</a></b> Select this to open the tab for the application in the main window.</li>
                <li><b><a href="threads.html">Thread Dump.</a></b> Select this to capture a thread dump for the application.
                When you capture a thread dump, the thread dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the thread dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b><a href="heapdump.html">Heap Dump.</a></b> Select this to capture a heap dump for the application.
                When you capture a heap dump, the heap dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the heap dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><a href="profiler.html"><b>Profile.</b></a> Select this to open the Profiler tab for the application.</li>
                <li><a href="snapshots.html"><b>Profiler Snapshot.</b></a> If the application is being profiled, you can select this to take
                a profiler snapshot. The snapshot opens in the main window and a snapshot node appears below the application node.</li>
                <li><a href="snapshots.html#application"><b>Application Snapshot.</b></a></li>
                <li><b>Enable Heap Dump on OOME.</b> Select this if you want VisualVM to automatically take a heap dump when
                an OutOfMemoryException is encountered. The heap dump is save to XXX.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Remote Node</h3><a name="remote"></a>
            <p>When VisualVM connects to a remote host, the remote host is listed as a node under the Remote node.
            When connected to a remote host, you can expand the node for the remote host to see the Java applications that are running on that host.
            When a Java application is launched on the remote host, a node for that application is displayed under the remote host node.</p>
            
            <p>You need to explicitly add the location of remote hosts if you want VisualVM to be able to connect to the host.
            Once a remote host is added, VisualVM persists the address of the remote host and will make a connection to the host each time 
            VisualVM is started. 
            If you do not want VisualVM to connect to the host on startup, you should right-click the remote host node and choose Remove
            before quitting VisualVM.</p>
            
            
            <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
            needs to be running on the remote host.
            To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
            The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of JDK 6.

            <p></p>
        
            <h3>Snapshots</h3><a name="snapshots"></a>
            <p>The Snapshots node lists application snapshots that are saved to your local system.
            You can right-click the Snapshots node to open save application snapshots.</p>
            An application snapshot can be saved to your local system and opened
            <p>Each application snapshot has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove</li>
                <li>Rename</li>
            </ul>
