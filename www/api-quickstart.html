        <h1>Getting Started Extending VisualVM</h1>
        
        <p>In this tutorial you will be
        introduced to the VisualVM API and you will be shown how to get
        started using it
        to extend VisualVM. Entry points into VisualVM fall into the
        following categories, each implemented by the factory pattern:
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tab extension.</b> 
            <li><b>Overview tab extension.</b> 
            <li><b>Menu extension.</b> 
            <li><b>Application type extension.</b> 
        </ul>    
        
        <h2>Hello World Scenario</h2>
        
        <h2>Further Reading</h2>
        
        <p>To continue learning about the VisualVM APIs, you are
        recommended to consult the following resources:
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>VisualVM Javadoc.</b></li>
            <li><b>VisualVM Plugins.</b> When you download the VisualVM
                sources, you will find that you have also downloaded the sources
                of a set of plugins. You can inspect these plugins and learn
                from them. At the time of writing, these plugins were as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>GlassFish.</b> This plugin provides a new application
                        type for the GlassFish server. A new application type node
                        is created for each running GlassFish instance. All deployed
                        applications are represented by subnodes, with further subnodes
                        for each servlet in the application. Furthermore, tabs specific
                        to each server instance, application, and servlet are also
                    provided.</li>
                    <li><b>MBeans.</b> This plugin provides a new tab for all
                    applications that have JMX enabled. The information provided
                    in the tab is exactly the same as the information provided by
                    the MBeans tab in the JDK's JConsole application.
                    <li><b>JConsole.</b> This plugin makes VisualVM receptive
                    to JConsole plugins, so that investment in JConsole plugins is
                    not lost when you transfer from JConsole to VisualVM.
                </ul>
                
            </li> 
            <li><b>Blog entries by Geertjan Wielenga.</b> Geertjan is
                the technical writer responsible for documenting the VisualVM APIs.
                While learning about the VisualVM APIs, he wrote a series of blog
                entries about the VisualVM APIs he was learning about. The relevant
                blog entries are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm"> Getting Started Extending VisualVM (Part 1)</a>.</b>
                     Here you create your first tab extension. You discover that VisualVM
                     tabs are broken down into master views, master view configurations,
                     and detail views.
                    <li><b><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">Getting Started Extending VisualVM (Part 2)</a>.</b>
                     Here you create an application type extension, with an overview
                     extension and menu extension specifically for the application type.
                    <li><b><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part1">Getting Started Extending VisualVM (Part 3)</a>.</b>
                     Here you are introduced to application type subnodes and you
                     are referred to the GlassFish plugin for related source code.
                </ul>    
            </li>
            
        </ol>
