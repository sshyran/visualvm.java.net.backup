        <h1>Working with Local Applications</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>When you start VisualVM, a node for each application running on a local JVM is displayed under the Local node in the Applications window.
        You can expand an application node to see the profiler snapshots, thread dumps and heap dumps of the application.
        Right-clicking an application node or sub-node invokes a popup menu enabling you to choose various actions.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The list of local applications always includes VisualVM.</p>    
 
        <p>A local application node generally has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Open.</b> Choose this to open the tab for the application in the main window where you can <b>view application data</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Thread Dump.</b> Choose this to <b>take a thread dump</b> for the application.
                The captured thread dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the thread dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b>Heap Dump.</b> Choose this to <b>take a heap dump</b> for the application.
                The captured heap dump opens in the main window and a node for the heap dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b>Profile.</b> Choose this to open the Profiler tab for the application where you can choose to <b>profile the application</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Profiler Snapshot.</b> Choose this to <b>take a snapshot</b> of the results from the profiling session.
                The profiler snapshot opens in the main window and a node for the snapshot appears under the application node.
                The command is only available when VisualVM is profiling the application.</li>
                <li><b>Application Snapshot.</b> Choose this to <b>take an application snapshot</b>.
                A node for the snapshot appears under the Snapshots node.</li>
                <li><b>Enable Heap Dump on OOME.</b> Select this if you want VisualVM to automatically take a heap dump when
                the application encounters an OutOfMemoryException.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Viewing Application Data</h3>
        <p>VisualVM displays data about each running local application in a dedicated tab in the main window.
        Each application tab has sub-tabs where information about that application is displayed.</p>
        <p>To open the application tab, right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Open.
        (Alternatively, double-click the application node.)
        When you click Open, the Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="overview_tab.html">Application Overview</a></p>


        <h3>Monitoring Application Activity</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to monitor a local application and view high-level data on thread activity and 
        memory heap, and garbage collection in the VM.</p>
        <p>For more see the following document:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="monitor_tab.html">Monitoring an Application</a></li></ul>

        <h3>Taking a Heap Dump</h3>
        <p>You can take a heap dump of a local application to capture a snapshot of the objects on the heap.</p>

        <p>You can take a heap dump in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Heap Dump.</li>
            <li>Click the Heap Dump button in the Monitor tab of the application tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you take a heap dump, the heap dump opens as a tab of the application in the main window.
        A node for the heap dump appears under the application node in the Applications window.
        </p>
        <p>For more see the following document:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="heapdump.html">Browsing a Heap Dump</a></li></ul>
        
        
        <h3>Taking a Thread Dump</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to take a thread dump to capture information about the active application threads
        at the time you take the thread dump.
        When you take a thread dump, the thread dump opens as a tab of the application in the main window.
        A node for the thread dump appears under the application node in the Applications window.</p>

        <p>You can take a thread dump in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Thread Dump.</li>
            <li>Click the Thread Dump button in the Threads tab of the application tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more see the following document:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="threads.html">Monitoring Application Threads</a></li></ul>


        <h3>Profiling an Application</h3>
        <p>VisualVM includes a profiler that enables you to analyze the performance and memory usage of a local application.
        You can profile an application without restarting it.
        </p>
        <p>VisualVM cannot be used to Profile itself - only the Overview and Monitor
        tabs are enabled when VisualVM is the chosen application.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="profiler.html">Using the Profiler</a></p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Taking Snapshots</h3>
        <p>VisualVM enables you to take snapshots that capture application data at the time the snapshot is taken.
        You can save snapshots to your local system and then examine them later.</p>
        <p>VisualVM enables you to take the following types of snapshots:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Profiler snapshots.</b> A profiler snapshot captures the profiling data at the moment the snapshot is takes.
        The snapshot is either a memory snapshot or a CPU snapshot.
        You can take a profiler snapshot only when you are profiling an application.</li>
        <li><b>Application snapshots.</b> An application snapshot is an archive that contains all the heap dumps, 
        thread dumps and snapshots that are listed below the application node. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For more see the following document:</p>
