        <h1>Working with Local Applications</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>When you start VisualVM, each Java application running on the local JVM is displayed as a node under the Local node in the <a href="applications_window.html">Applications window</a>.
        You can expand an application node to see the profiler snapshots, thread dumps and heap dumps of the application.
        Right-clicking an application node or sub-node invokes a popup menu enabling you to choose various actions.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The list of local applications will always include VisualVM.</p>    
 
        <!--<p>A local application node generally has the following items available in the popup menu.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="overview_tab.html">Open.</a></b> Opens the tab for the application in the main window.</li>
                <li><b><a href="threads.html">Thread Dump.</a></b> Captures a thread dump for the application.
                When you capture a thread dump, the thread dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the thread dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><b><a href="heapdump.html">Heap Dump.</a></b> Captures a heap dump for the application.
                When you capture a heap dump, the heap dump opens in the main window and a node
                for the heap dump appears under the application node.</li>
                <li><a href="profiler.html"><b>Profile.</b></a> Opens the Profiler tab for the application where you can choose to profile the application.</li>
                <li><a href="snapshots.html"><b>Profiler Snapshot.</b></a> Takes a snapshot of the profiling data at the moment.
                The snapshot is either a memory snapshot or a CPU snapshot.
                If VisualVM is not profiling the application the Profiler Snapshot command is not available.
                The profiler snapshot opens in the main window and a snapshot node appears below the application node.</li>
                <li><a href="snapshots.html#application"><b>Application Snapshot.</b></a> Takes an application snapshot that contains 
                archives all the dumps and snapshots. 
                The command is not available if there are no dumps or snapshots listed below the application node.</li>
                <li><b>Enable Heap Dump on OOME.</b> Select this if you want VisualVM to automatically take a heap dump when
                an OutOfMemoryException is encountered. The heap dump is save to XXX.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Viewing Application Data</h3>
        <p>VisualVM displays data about each running local application in a dedicated tab in the main window.
        By default, the application tab is closed.</p>
        <p>To open the application tab, right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Open.
        When you click Open, the Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="overview_tab.html">Application Overview</a></p>


        <h3>Monitoring Application Activity</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to monitor a local application and view high-level data on thread activity 
        and memory heap and garbage collection in the VM.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="monitor_tab.html">Monitoring an Application</a></p>

        <h3>Taking a Heap Dump</h3>
        <p>You can take a heap dump of a local application to capture a snapshot of the objects on the heap.
        </p>

        <p>You can take a heap dump in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Heap Dump.</li>
            <li>Click the Heap Dump button in the Monitor tab of the application tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you take a heap dump, the heap dump opens as a tab of the application in the main window.
        A node for the heap dump appears under the application node in the Applications window.
        </p>
        <p>For more see <a href="heapdump.html">Browsing a Heap Dump</a></p>
        
        
        <h3>Taking a Thread Dump</h3>
        <p>You can use VisualVM to take a thread dump to capture information about the active application threads
        at the time you take the thread dump.</p>

        <p>You can take a thread dump in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Thread Dump.</li>
            <li>Click the Thread Dump button in the Threads tab of the application tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you take a thread dump, the thread dump opens as a tab of the application in the main window.
        A node for the thread dump appears under the application node in the Applications window.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="threads.html">Monitoring Application Threads</a></p>


        
        


        <h3>Profiling the Application</h3>
        <p>VisualVM includes a profiler that enables you to analyze the performance and analyze memory usage of a local application.</p>
        <p>VisualVM cannot be used to Profile itself - only the Overview and Monitor
        tabs are enabled when VisualVM is the chosen application.</p>
        <p>For more see <a href="profiler.html">Using the Profiler</a></p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Taking Snapshots</h3>
        <p>VisualVM enables you to take snapshots that capture application data at the time the snapshot is taken.
        You can save snapshots to the local system.
        You can send snapshots to other users.
        You can open and view snapshots when the application is not running.</p>
