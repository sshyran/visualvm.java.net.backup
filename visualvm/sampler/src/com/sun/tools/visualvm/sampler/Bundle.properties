OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Profiling
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This module implements a sampling CPU and memory profiler (in contrast to the Profiler which uses instrumentation).\
    <BR><BR>\nCPU profiling requires a JMX connection to the monitored application, once correctly set up you can profile both local and remote applications.\
    <BR><BR>\nMemory profiling requires Attach API, so only local applications running on JDK 6+ are supported.
