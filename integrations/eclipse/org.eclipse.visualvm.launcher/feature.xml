   <description>
      VisualVM is a visual tool integrating several commandline JDK
tools and lightweight profiling capabilities. Designed for both
production and development time use, it further enhances the
capability of monitoring and performance analysis for the Java
SE platform.
This launcher makes monitoring your eclipse based applications
as easy as launching them from the IDE.
